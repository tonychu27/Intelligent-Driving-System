"""
This module provides an example control for vehicles which
does not use CARLA's vehicle engine.

Limitations:
- Does not respect any traffic regulation: speed limit, traffic light, priorities, etc.
- Can only consider obstacles in forward facing reaching (i.e. in tight corners obstacles may be ignored).

class SimpleVehicleControl(BasicControl):

    """
    Controller class for vehicles derived from BasicControl.

    The controller directly sets velocities in CARLA, therefore bypassing
    CARLA's vehicle engine. This allows a very precise speed control, but comes
    with limitations during cornering.

    In addition, the controller can consider blocking obstacles, which are
    classified as dynamic (i.e. vehicles, bikes, pedestrians). Activation of this
    features is controlled by passing proper arguments to the class constructor.
    The collision detection uses CARLA's obstacle sensor (sensor.other.obstacle),
    which checks for obstacles in the direct forward channel of the vehicle, i.e.
    there are limitation with sideways obstacles and while cornering.

    Args:
        actor (carla.Actor): Vehicle actor that should be controlled.
        args (dictionary): Dictonary of (key, value) arguments to be used by the controller.
                           May include: (consider_obstacles, true/false) - Enable consideration of obstacles
                                        (proximity_threshold, distance)  - Distance in front of actor in which
                                                                           obstacles are considered
                                        (attach_camera, true/false)      - Attach OpenCV display to actor
                                                                           (useful for debugging)

    Attributes:

        _generated_waypoint_list (list of carla.Transform): List of target waypoints the actor
            should travel along. A waypoint here is of type carla.Transform!
            Defaults to [].
        _last_update (float): Last time step the update function (tick()) was called.
            Defaults to None.
        _consider_obstacles (boolean): Enable/Disable consideration of obstacles
            Defaults to False.
        _proximity_threshold (float): Distance in front of actor in which obstacles are considered
            Defaults to infinity.
        _cv_image (CV Image): Contains the OpenCV image, in case a debug camera is attached to the actor
            Defaults to None.
        _camera (sensor.camera.rgb): Debug camera attached to actor
            Defaults to None.
        _obstacle_sensor (sensor.other.obstacle): Obstacle sensor attached to actor
            Defaults to None.
        _obstacle_distance (float): Distance of the closest obstacle returned by the obstacle sensor
            Defaults to infinity.
        _obstacle_actor (carla.Actor): Closest obstacle returned by the obstacle sensor
            Defaults to None.
